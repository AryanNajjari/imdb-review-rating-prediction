ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Review Rating Prediction

This project uses Qwen, a large language model, to analyze movie reviews from the IMDB dataset and predict their corresponding numeric ratings (from 1 to 10). The model is fine-tuned on reviewâ€“rating pairs and evaluated on unseen test data.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository demonstrates a workflow for:

Cleaning and preparing the IMDB dataset

Training a Qwen model on textual movie reviews and their correlated ratings

Evaluating model accuracy and prediction quality on test reviews

Visualizing and analyzing model performance

ðŸ§  Model

The model is based on Qwen â€” a transformer-based large language model.
It was fine-tuned using IMDB reviews where each review text corresponds to a numeric rating (1â€“10).

Key steps:

Preprocessing and tokenization

Fine-tuning on promptâ€“completion pairs

Evaluation on held-out test reviews

Generating predicted ratings

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Over 60% of the test data points were predicted with exact accuracy or within Â±1 of the actual rating, approximately 12% showed a Â±2-point deviation, and about 28% differed by more than 2 points from the actual ratings.
